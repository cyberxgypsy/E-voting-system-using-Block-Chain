Democratic voting is a crucial and serious event in any country, the current voting 
scheme in any country is through ballot paper or by use of EVM. These processes have 
many drawbacks such as transparency, low voter turn-out, tampering of votes, distrust 
in the election body, forging of unique Id (voter id card), delay in giving out results and 
the most important is security issues. Security of digital voting is always the biggest 
concern when considering to implement a digital voting system. With such monumental 
decisions at stake, there can be no doubt about the systemâ€™s ability to secure data and 
defend against potential attacks. One way the security issues can be potentially solved 
is through the use of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology offers infinite 
number of applications. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows digital 
assets to be transacted in a peer-to-peer decentralized network. A distributed ledger 
technology is an exciting advancement in this regard. Block is a collection of all the 
transactions. Blockchain possess salient features such as immutability, 
Decentralization, Security, Transparency and anonymity. Blockchain with smart 
contracts emerges as a promising candidate for building a safer, secure and transparent 
E-voting systems.
Blockchain is offering new opportunities to develop new types of digital services. While 
research on the topic is still emerging, it has mostly focused on the technical and legal 
issues instead of taking advantage of this novel concept and creating advanced digital 
services. In this paper, we are going to leverage the open source Blockchain technology 
to propose a design for a new electronic voting system that could be used in local or 
national elections. The Blockchain-based system will be secure, reliable, and 
anonymous, and will help increase the number of voters as well as the trust of people in 
their governments
